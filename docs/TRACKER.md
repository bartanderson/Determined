tools/analysis - TRACKER (consolidated)
=========================================

This file is the canonical open-items list for the Determined analysis tool.
Active open items only. Closed items are deleted — for historical context use git log.
For architecture/intent, see DESIGN.md. For doc structure, see docs/README.md.

Per CLAUDE.md's working agreement: update this file in place as work completes
(checkboxes, dated notes) so Bart can see what changed via `git diff`.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

These are standing architectural commitments, not tasks. Apply when making
implementation decisions, not scheduled as work items.

**UI-CLI parity (aspirational 100%):**
Every capability that produces a result a human would act on must be reachable
from the UI — not just the common-path workflows. The UI is the canonical map of
what the tool can do. Exceptions are internal plumbing only (schema helpers, debug
internals, emit machinery) — not "too advanced" judgments about user need.
The Workbench tab is the natural home for full tool coverage; it should be a
complete tool picker, not a demo surface.
Corollary: if I'm about to write a new socket handler, there should be a UI
affordance for it before the session ends. Capability without UI access is
a half-shipped feature.

**GOT model (navigation-first):**
The editor is the navigation hub. Every surface connects back to it.
Search is secondary to browsing. Panels expose what the corpus knows,
not what we decided to show. See docs/UI_VISION.md for full statement.

**Design oracle posture:**
Proposals are evidence of goals, not specs. Extract intent before building.
Apply pressure before improving. Disagree when warranted. Code follows
understanding, not the other way around.

## RM67 — Convergence protocol (COMPLETE — maintenance mode)

Determined is done. RM67 is the standing regression check: when running
Determined against dj2 or any other corpus, if the tool gets something wrong,
fix it here. No scheduled development. Fix regressions when they appear.

### Language scope

| Corpus | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Determined (Python) | Full convergence | probe 2026-08-05 (fresh re-ingest): 1 real stub (suggest_tags, known accepted), 9 test mocks, 0 false positives; ABC gaps: clean; 95.4% unresolved edges (external-lib ceiling, accepted); 587 EPs in determined/ (0 stubs); all 3 convergence criteria met |
| dj2 (Python+JS) | Full convergence | probe 2026-08-06: 25 stubs — 12 FSM (accepted), 3 test (accepted), 5 subrace/RM68 delete candidates, 5 production gaps (_get_combat_context, _get_encounter_context, on_arc_completed, process_consequences, _register_world_tools); all 3 convergence criteria met; EP and CrossEdges now meaningfully distinct columns |
| Commonplace (Python) | Full convergence | 1 stub (suggest_tags); frontier stub, waits for LLM_ENDPOINT design decision |
| rotjs (TS) | Probe-passes | 6 stubs; lib/src dual-rep known |
| dungeoncrawler (TS) | Probe-passes | 0 stubs; clean |
| dnd-dungeon-gen (JS) | Probe-passes | 6 stubs; JS callee resolution gap known |
| end-of-eden (Go) | Probe-passes | 0 stubs; 15% unresolved (external libs, correct) |
| ruggrogue (Rust) | Probe-passes | 0 stubs; normalize_symbol strip known |
| slater (Rust) | Probe-passes | 195 files, 0 stubs, 1985 inferred EPs (tests/benchmarks, correct); async boundary blind |
| brogue-ce (C) | Probe-passes | 977 symbols, 7233 edges; 30 true stubs; cellHasTerrainFlag HOT (96 callers) |
| llm.c (C+Python+CUDA) | Probe-passes | 729 symbols / 2960 edges; 148 CUDA kernels; 22 stubs (mostly false-positives) |
| mach (Zig) | Probe-passes | 3425 symbols / 9359 edges; 80 stubs all correct (C FFI + ObjC); 14% resolution (expected ceiling) |
| clx (Lua) | Probe-passes | 529 symbols / 996 edges; 2 Lua stubs correct; 46% resolution |
| LearnWebGPU (C++) | Probe-passes | 656 symbols / 1730 edges; 3 true stubs; macro-hidden STRUCT/END bug fixed |
| raylib (C++) | Probe-passes | 13280 symbols / 59435 edges; 3485 stubs = header-only libs + GPU API bindings — accepted ceiling |
| zig-gamedev (Zig) | Probe-passes | 4999 symbols / 20682 edges; 668 stubs after dedup; remaining = C FFI to Dear ImGui — accepted ceiling |
| ebiten (Go) | Probe-passes | 6367 symbols / 45073 edges; 50 stubs = proprietary platform SDK stubs (Nintendo/PS5) — correctly unimplementable |
| batteries (Lua) | Probe-passes | 451 symbols / 706 edges; 0 stubs; clean |

HTML: best-effort. Capture js_event_binding edges; don't model HTML structure.

## RM68 — Remove subrace concept from dj2

**[dj2 REPO ONLY — NOT A DETERMINED TASK — NEVER ACT ON THIS IN A DETERMINED SESSION]**

The OG system rewrite dropped subraces. Current dnd_data.py stubs (subraces,
get_subraces_for_race, get_race_for_subrace, semantic_match_subrace,
semantic_match_fighting_style) are dead concept remnants — do not implement.

**Scope (3 files):** world/dnd_data.py (5 stubs), world/character_generator.py,
world/authority_system.py.

**Approach:** blast_radius each subrace stub to confirm low impact, then remove.

**Gate: dj2 session only. Surfaces naturally from Determined analysis of dj2.**
